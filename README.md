# Project Setup Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

1. Navigate to the `live` folder in your project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file in the `live` folder.
3. Add your `GLADIA_API_KEY` to the `.env` file in the following format:

   ```bash
   GLADIA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
````

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Open a command line or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the `live` folder:

   ```bash
   cd live
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Step 3: Run the Application

1. After installing the dependencies, start the application:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

The application should now be up and running.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure your `.env` file contains the correct `GLADIA_API_KEY` value.
- If you encounter any issues during installation or setup, please verify that your environment variables are correctly configured and that all dependencies were successfully installed.
